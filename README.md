# ML_models_from_scratch

While learning about machine learning algorithms, I wanted to build them from scratch without importing the complete model from libraries to understand how they work. Within this repository are the models I built: <br>
General Linear Models(GLMs), Naive Bayes, Decision trees, Random Forest, Adaptive Boosting(AdaBoost), and gradient boosting trees.
